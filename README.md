# JoyOfCoding-WritingFunctions
Learning Exercise: Writing Functions

1. Write a function, add, that takes two numbers as parameters and 
returns their sum. 

2. Write a function, multiply, that takes two numbers as parameters 
and returns their product. 

3. Now, test! Write python code that gets two numbers as input from 
the user and prints out their sum and product by calling the two 
functions above. Bonus points for putting this part in a main function.

Practice Problems: 
 
1. Write a function, pyramid, that takes a single character and a number as parameters and 
displays an ASCII art pyramid to the screen with number rows: 
 
|Example call|Displays|
|---|---|
|pyramid(“\*”, 2)|<pre><code>*<br>**</code></pre>
|pyramid(“+”, 5)|<pre><code>+<br>++<br>+++<br>++++<br>+++++</code></pre> 
|pyramid(“x”, 10)|<pre><code>x<br>xx<br>xxx<br>xxxx<br>xxxxx<br>xxxxxx<br>xxxxxxx<br>xxxxxxxx<br>xxxxxxxxx<br>xxxxxxxxxx</code></pre> 
 
2. Write a function, absolute_difference, that takes two numbers as parameters and 
returns their absolute difference: 
 
|Example call|Returns|
|---|---|
absolute_difference(5, 10)|5 
absolute_difference(10, 5)|5 
absolute_difference(200, -200)|400
